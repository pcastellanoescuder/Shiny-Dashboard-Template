I obtained my Bachelor degree in Biology at the University of Barcelona (UB) in June 2016. In July 2017 I obtained my Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Open University of Catalonia (UOC). My master thesis was titled "Prediction model of response to a certain treatment in childhood obesity" supervised by Prof. Esteban Vegas Lozano.  

During my bachelor and master degree studies, I focused my research on the search of epigenetic and metabolomic biomarkers in Childhood obesity.  

Currently, I am PhD student in the Biomedicine Doctorate Programme of UB under the supervision of Prof. Alexandre Sánchez Pla and Prof. Cristina Andrés Lacueva. My research is focused on food metabolomics.
